# Warriors
We believe that the person fighting with Breast Cancer should not be referred to as a survivor or a patient. They are Warriors and in the documentation, we would call them rightly so.

Problem
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women that have more severe mental and emotional effects than other types of cancers (Ramezani, 2001; Saniah and Zainal, 2010; Sharif Nia et al., 2017). 

Diagnosis of breast cancer is an extremely unpleasant and unbelievable experience for each person that can disrupt family life (Vedat et al., 2001). Meanwhile, fears and worries about the death and recurrence of the disease, mental impairment, financial concerns and family problems lead to the emergence and increase of severity of psychiatric disorders such as depression (Kai-na et al., 2011; Shakeri et al., 2015; Dowlatabadi et al., 2016).

Solution
The problem becomes severe when the Warrior feels that they are the only one facing the problems and no one understands their fears and worries. A sense of community could bring joy and happiness in their lives. Warriors App aims just to do that. To be a one-stop place where the warriors can book their appointments with a doctor or a therapist, track their diets, share their stories or read other warriors’ stories, examine themselves and get motivated by motivational quotes made just for them every day.

The battle with cancer is a tough one and one can starting feeling low either during the battle or after it. So its important to always keep our Warriors motivated.

6. Health Dashboard
Warriors are confronted with a serious diagnosis that requires them to make important decisions throughout the journey of the disease. For these decisions to be made it is critical that the warriors be well informed. Previous studies have been consistent in their findings that they have a high need for nutritions and most of the time information is scarce. The App makes it a tad bit easier for them. It tracks their nutrition needs, calorie needs, hydration level, pulse rates, oxygen level etc to provide them with the best care.

The users of the app can see a list of the breast cancer doctors/surgeons with their basic details like name, address, phone number and details.

Depression is one of the major side effects of breast cancer which can be tougher to beat than breast cancer itself. So breast cancer patients might need professional help to deal with this. Hence, our app provides a list of therapists near them.
